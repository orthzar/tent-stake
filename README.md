# An unusual tent stake that you can 3d print.

Feel free to print this tent stake. Even though the tip is not straight, it should go into the ground fine.

Warning: I have not printed this yet, so don't bet your expensive tent on this stake without doing your own testing first!

The .sb file is an Antimony file, in case you want to see how the sausage was made.
