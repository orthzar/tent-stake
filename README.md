# An unusual tent stake that you can 3d print.

Feel free to print this tent stake. Even though the tip is not straight, it should go into the ground fine.

Warning: I have not printed this yet, so don't bet your expensive tent on this stake without doing your own testing first!

The .sb file is a CAD file made using [Antimony](https://github.com/mkeeter/antimony/), in case you want to see how the sausage was made.
